yeah
peace!

aristocrats on a mountain climb
making money, losing time
communism is just a word
but if the government turn over
it'll be the only word that's heard

america, america
god shed his grace on thee
america, america
keep the children free

little sister making minimum wage
living in a one room jungle-monkey cage
can't get over, she's almost dead
she may not be in the black
but she's happy she ain't in the red

america, america
god shed his grace on thee
america, america
keep the children free
