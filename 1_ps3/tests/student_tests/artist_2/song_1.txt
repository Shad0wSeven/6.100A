god, bless america,
land that i love.
stand beside her,
and guide her
through the night with a light from above.
from the mountains
to the prairies
to the oceans white with foam,
god, bless america,
my home, sweet home.
god bless america
land that i love
stand beside her
and guide her

from the mountains
to the prairies
to the oceans white with foam
god bless america
my home sweet home
god bless america...
my home sweet home!
