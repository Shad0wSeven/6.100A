o beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain 
for purple mountain majesties, above the fruited plain 
america, america, god shed his grace on thee 
and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea 

o beautiful for pilgrim feet, whose stern impassioned stress 
a thoroughfare for freedom beat, across the wilderness 
america, america, god mend thine every flaw 
confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law 

o beautiful for heroes proved, in liberating strife 
who more than self their country loved, and mercy more than life 
america, america, may god they gold refine 
till all success be nobleness, and every gain divine 

o beautiful for patriot dream, that sees beyond the years 
thine alabaster cities gleam, undimmed by human tears 
america, america, god shed his grace on thee 
and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea
