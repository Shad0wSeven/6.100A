 don't want a lot for christmas
there is just one thing i need
i don't care about the presents
underneath the christmas tree
i just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true oh
all i want for christmas is you
i don't want a lot for christmas
there is just one thing i need, and i
don't care about the presents
underneath the christmas tree
i don't need to hang my stocking
there upon the fireplace
santa claus won't make me happy
with a toy on christmas day
i just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true
all i want for christmas is you
i won't ask for much this christmas
i won't even wish for snow, and i
i just wanna keep on waiting
underneath the mistletoe
i won't make a list and send it
to the north pole for saint nick
i won't even stay awake
to hear those magic reindeer click
'cause i just want you here tonight
holding on to me so tight
what more can i do
oh, baby all i want for christmas is you
all the lights are shining
so brightly everywhere
and the sound of children's
laughter fills the air
and everyone is singing
i hear those sleigh bells ringing
santa won't you bring me
the one i really need
won't you please bring my baby to me quickly
i don't want a lot for christmas
this is all i'm asking for
i just wanna see my baby
standing right outside my door
i just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true
baby all i want for christmas is you
all i want for christmas is you, baby
