have yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
from now on your troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on your troubles will be miles away
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
tgather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest place
so have yourself a merry little christmas
have yourself a merry little christmas
so have yourself a merry little christmas
